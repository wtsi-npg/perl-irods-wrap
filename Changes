 - Remove from test matrix iRODS 4.1.12
 - Add iRODS 4.2.8 to test matrix
    
   iRODS 4.2.8 is marked as an expected failure because we have not yet

   the sequence data is primary; off instrument base calls -or- secondary; has 
   been subsequently post processed via additional analysis e.g. raw subreads 
   from the same SMRTbell sequence have been combined to produce a one 
   high quality (circular consensus) sequence.

      error results in deletion rather than tagging for inspection
      post-failure "staging=1" AVU ignored rather than error

   delimiter, instead of underscore (e.g. dcterms_title to
   dcterms::title). These have not yet been used in production.

 - Added metadata keys alt_process, alt_target, alignment_filter.

 - Added caching behaviour for data access groups to avoid executing
   igroupadmin in WTSI::NPG::iRODS.

 - Added dependency on MooseX::StrictConstructor.

Release 2.0.3

 - Set the TODO flag on UTF-8 round tripping as a workaround for some

Release 2.0.2

 - Added support for a TEST_PERFORMANCE environment variable. If set,
   the performance tests will be run. The default is not to run them.

   the iRODS test environment is not declared, the tests will fail. If
   not set and the iRODS test environment is not declared, the tests
   will skip.

   $WTSI::NPG::iRODS::Metadata::SAMPLE_CONSENT_WITHDRAWN in updating
   ACLs from study metadata.
