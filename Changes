Unreleased 

Release 3.25.0 (2024-10-25)

 - Added csi index file type to WTSI::NPG::iRODS::Annotator
  
Release 3.24.1 (2024-10-04)

 - Fix handling of undefined data release strategy
 - Improve error handling when listing collections (add early returns).
 - Move Perlbrew install to a script so that it can be used by both
   GitHub Actions and Docker.
 - Added .github/dependabot.yml file to auto-update GitHub actions
 - Following a release on 07/09/2024, see https://metacpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/changes
   the checksum of the script served by https://install.perlbrew.pl had changed.
   https://install.perlbrew.pl is a redirect to raw
   https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/blob/master/perlbrew-install, so
   the change originates from GitHub and can be trusted. Our CI flow compares
   the checksum of the downloaded script to the expected value. We now store
   an updated expected checksum value, which corresponds to the latest release.

Release 3.24.0 (2024-09-02)

 - populate_wtsi_irods_groups now sets ss_<STUDY_ID>_human group membership if
   these have been set in the contaminated_human_data_access_group field

 - Change populate_wtsi_irods_groups.pl to only populate iRODS
   study access groups with all seq iRODS users for SS studies
   with empty data access where the study is not managed e.g.
   submitted to EGA not ENA

Release 3.23.0 (2024-07-25)

 - Add PACBIO_ISOSEQ_PRIMERS to Metadata - required for archiving
   analysis output from IsoSeq analysis jobs

Release 3.22.2 (2024-05-24)

 - Add iRODS 4.3.2, remove 4.3-nightly

Release 3.22.1

 - avoid uninitialized value in addition when human group not created

Release 3.22.0

 - Introduced ss_<STUDY_ID>_human iRODS group to provide limited
   access to split-out human data. Specific changes:
     - exposed ensure_group_exists method from iRODS::GroupAdmin
     - populate_wtsi_irods_groups creates _human iRODS groups
     - tests fixtures extended to include these new iRODS groups
     - reimplemented expected_groups from WTSI::NPG::irods::Path
       to return all groups that are appropriate for an object or
       a collection; this method consolidates all logic about
       study-related access to data, this logic was previously split
       between WTSI::NPG::irods::Path and WTSI::NPG::irods::DataObject
 - Fixed incorrect example in POD
