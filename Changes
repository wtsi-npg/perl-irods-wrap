Upcoming


 - Order Conda channels for tests so that NPG channels have highest priority
   and conda-forge the lowest.
 - Remove RabbitMQ code

   from the same SMRTbell sequence have been combined to produce a one 
   high quality (circular consensus) sequence.

 - Added caching behaviour for data access groups to avoid executing
   igroupadmin in WTSI::NPG::iRODS.

 - Added dependency on MooseX::StrictConstructor.

Release 2.0.3

 - Set the TODO flag on UTF-8 round tripping as a workaround for some

Release 2.0.2

 - Added support for a TEST_PERFORMANCE environment variable. If set,
   the performance tests will be run. The default is not to run them.

   the iRODS test environment is not declared, the tests will fail. If
   not set and the iRODS test environment is not declared, the tests

   $WTSI::NPG::iRODS::Metadata::SAMPLE_CONSENT_WITHDRAWN in updating
   ACLs from study metadata.
